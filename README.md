# Map1

This project is a test exercise.
This one was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.3.
And connected with Yandex map API.

## Yandex map API KEY

Yandex map API KEY must be in the environments files:
* src/environments/environment.ts
* src/environments/environment.prod.ts

For example:

`export const environment = {
  yandexApiKey: '41f03ef3-1409-4613-b914-ec66162d7665',
};`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
